### Mission



The world like she has never been seen before.  

This Jaanga cookbook section contains the demo for building a 3D Globe using Three.js and Open Street Map data. 
The apps support the full 18 levels of zoom provided by OSM. 
The tooltips for the '+' and '-" buttons display the current zoom level.

Have a look at:

<http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook/osome-globe/r2/>
- Globe with 18 zooms levels

<http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook/osome-globe/r4/>
- Globe with 3D level data down to zoom level 3.

Derivation of the name oSome Globe: oSome = OSM + awesome + "Oh! That's some Globe!"


## General controls

* Rotate globe: Left mouse / press 1 finger
* Zoom in current level: Mousewheel / two fingers
