This app is coding example of a simple Chinese character dictionary as a web app.  

The code demonstrates that building a Chinese character web app is doable. Frankly it seems to be very easy.

The various apps and Chrome extensions currently on the market already cover a wide variety of needs. 
Nothing screams out right now that there is something cool and new to be done.

At some time is the future though, it might be fun to look at using Three.js and the canvas tag to display multibyte characters in 3D along with the legion of associated available visual effects.

Thank to Paul Masson for the stimulus to do this work. 
It is yet another example of stuff that was incredibly hard to do a few years that has come to a such a level of simplicity that even old duffers can learn how to build an app in a matter of hours.
